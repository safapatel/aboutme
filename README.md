# About Me
Ever since my first computer science class in high school, I have had an undying passion for software engineering. From printing 'Hello, world', to working on multiple projects, this passion keeps growing. 
To further enhnace my passion and skills, I am currently studying computer science with a concentration in software engineering at UIC where I study multiple languages, algorithms, and build projects. 
Currently, as I look forward to graduation, I have started to use my skills such as my knowledge in C and C++, problem solving, and communication which I can bring to a Chicago- based company thatâ€™s dedicated to growing in technology.
