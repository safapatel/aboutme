# About Me
Ever since my first computer science class in high school, I have had an undying passion for software engineering. From printing 'Hello, world', to working on multiple projects, this passion keeps growing. 
To further enhnace my passion and skills, I am currently studying computer science with a concentration in software engineering at UIC.
